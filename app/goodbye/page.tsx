          <p>
            After 7 months, I am putting this project to rest. Here are some
            final statistics- I think imalockin has lived a good life.
          </p>
          <ul className="!list-disc !list-inside space-y-1 marker:text-neutral-700">
            <li>130 registered users</li>
            <li>6,065 locked in sessions</li>
            <li>1,788 tasks completed</li>
            <li>2,294 hours spent locking in</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This project meant a lot to me and honestly achieved more success
            than I could have imagined. I am so grateful for each of you who
            used it, contributed ideas, supported it, gave feedback, or even
            just took a look. It means a lot.
          </p>

            It‚Äôs time for me to move on and face new challenges though. I didn‚Äôt
            want to leave this project unmaintained or barely keep it alive
            through updates which don‚Äôt challenge my engineering ability. I
            learned so much from developing imalockin, and I hope it was useful
            to somebody. It has served its purpose and unfortunately, it is time
            to lock out.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thank you again for being part of this chapter of my life. ü§ç
